## Tasks
### [Task 1](task1/)
*Description:* Refer to C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos to:
- Compile C code using gcc.
- Compile and count the number of instructions used in ofast and o1 using the RISC-V compiler.
### [Task 2](Task2/)
*Description:* Refer to C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos to:
